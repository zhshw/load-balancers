This might impose some constraints on the designs chosen.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I don't believe that the plaintext algorithm meets this goal.  The server ID can take all the available space, which is probably wrong.  Clearly it is impossible to create sufficient connection IDs for even a single connection if there is only one valid identifier per server.  However, it might be argued that even an 18 byte server ID makes it too easy to guess a valid connection ID for a connection (just 16 guesses would be enough to get a 50% chance at that).  So it seems to me that a shorter connection ID is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to any attempt at obfuscation.\r\n\r\nThe encrypted versions might be similarly challenging to get right.  The For Server Use field in the stream cipher variant needs to be sufficiently long as to avoid engineered collisions.  The value used for the stream cipher is malleable, which means that an attacker isn't prevented from guessing.  In many ways, this is more challenging than the plaintext variant because the nonce consumes space.\r\n\r\nThe zero-padding in the block cipher mode might be the best way of preventing guessing, if it were sufficiently long.  Similarly, if \"Encrypted bits for server use\" were sufficiently sparsely populated, then guessing can be hard enough.",

For all but BCID with zero-padding, the answer is clearly \"yes\" unless the SID space is sparsely populated. But that doesn't make them valid at the server. Moreover, if I am just trying to get random packets past the LB, it's far more productive to just generate a bunch of Initials.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an LB, all CIDs get through to the server, so I don't understand why this is a problem.\r\n\r\n2) The transport draft language (it seems to me) exists mostly to prevent linkability in migration events. Although I've mentioned several times that linkability is a continuum, it is pretty clear that PCID fails at this and OCID makes it harder but no one would bet the house on it being truly secure -- hence the name.\r\n\r\nI think we're due for an actual WG discussion on OCID, but for PCID would it be sufficient for you, MT, if we said that servers using PCID MUST use disable_migration?

Whether this is practically useful information depends on the number of connections being managed by the individual servers.\r\n\r\nIMO, we cannot restrict the full set of QUIC features to only work on the most complex and costly algorithms.

Worse yet, the client has no idea, without a lot of effort, what the servers are doing. Even worse, the servers have some incentives to pick something that's easily linkable.\r\n\r\nIn Section 8, it says:\r\n\r\n> Servers that are running the Plaintext CID algorithm SHOULD only use it to generate new CIDs for the Server Initial Packet and SHOULD NOT send CIDs in QUIC NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames\r\n\r\nThis is a concise way of not giving the client tools to link itself by trying an unsafe migration.\r\n\r\nWe could just stick with that. A richer way to go would be to create a new transport parameter (e.g. cid_is_linkable, cid_not_encrypted) that would explicitly communicate the risks to the client. We could have a different value for OCID or batch PCID and OCID together.\r\n",

      "body": "We've had some discussion in this area in the past, and we decided that the best way to statelessly (and consistently) load balance long header packets would be to use a hash of the UDP 4-tuple and the client's source CID; since these are the only constants for all incoming (to the server) long header packets. I have come up with a couple of problems with this approach:\r\n\r\n1. As far as I know, there is no statement in the Invariants that says these must all stay constant for all future versions of QUIC.\r\n\r\n2. Using the hash approach can only function statelessly if there is not change in the DIP configuration. If the set of servers being load balanced changes (which we must assume to be common), then whatever stateless logic you have that maps hash to DIP would also change, resulting in long header packets getting routed incorrectly most likely.\r\n\r\n3. A follow up to (2), if you assume that the long header packets cannot therefore be routed statelessly based on the hash, and state must be tracked to continue to consistently route all long header packets until they are no longer used, at what point can the LB discard this state. By design, there is no on-path signal to indicate \"long header packets are no longer used\". Any heuristic that might be added here would be affected by (1) too.\r\n\r\nBecause of these issues, I'm left scratching my head on the best way to recommend to LBs on how to load balance invariant long header packets. The best thing I can think of is:\r\n\r\n- Use the hash mentioned above, but maintain state for each flow (tuple+client_cid).\r\n- Reset a timer (5 sec? 10 sec? 30 sec?) after each new packet is received for the flow. Discard the state when the timer fires.\r\n\r\nBecause the client's CID is included in the flow calculation, it allows an attacker to create nearly unlimited number of flow states on the LB. You might argue that Retry could be first used by a (cooperating) DoS appliance to first validate source address, but after that is done, this attack can still be executed. It would then require some heuristics on the LB to protect against.\r\n\r\n@martinduke @martinthomson any ideas here? ",

I.e. if you route an incoming TCP connection from a  stateless L4LB to backend servers based on 4-tuple hash, any change in number of backend servers can result in the routing of subsequent packets for the same flow to a different backend server.\r\n\r\nUsing LRU cache for such connection table in L4LB has been a convenient way to address this issue for us ( for >99% of the flows). You may need to tune parameters such as size and TTL for items in the table to your needs. \r\nAlso, a pre-configured upper bound to limit the size of the connection table should address the concern you mentioned regarding exposure to attack vector of unlimited states in L4LB. \r\n\r\nFinally, even for LongHeader packets, packets of type 'Handshake' echo back the \"destination connection id' chosen by the server. So you can use similar logic to route these LongHeader sub-types as you use to route ShortHeader packets if the servers and L4Lb cooperatively choose the 'destination connection Id' [for e.g. as @martinduke  proposed].",

I suppose a later version could drastically lengthen the time that non-server-generated CIDs were used, but I don't see why they would. The time scale till we get a server-generated CID is quite small, and if somehow the hash still messes up, the only affect is that 0RTT packets get sprayed where they aren't useful.

But you don't always have an existing mapping.  That might be because you don't know if the connection ID was generated locally, or because you know for certain that it wasn't.  In those cases, the only thing you have to fall back on is the addressing information.  So as Udip says, keeping a cache of flows for those packets you can't recognize is sensible.\r\n\r\nIn reading this, I was thinking \"what can the invariants draft say about this?\"  And it seems like there is something we could say here.\r\n\r\nRight now, when you get a packet, there is some uncertainty about whether the destination connection ID is one of yours.  That is pretty much unavoidable for the long header, unless we create a new invariant way of signaling this (which I don't think we will do).  However, for the short header, I think we could say, definitively, that the connection ID is one that the destination server has selected.  That might help load balancers in this situation.  From my reading of this thread, it seems like this property was assumed throughout, but I realize that we never wrote that down.\r\n\r\n(You can avoid relying on this property by making your connection IDs self-authenticating, but you always have to suffer some false-positive chance, as the amount of data is pretty low.)\r\n\r\n",

If we move the first point to the invariants doc (and I think we should), then you can just talk about the one assumption: that addressing information doesn't change until after the server is able to give the client a connection ID that works for proper routing.\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't completely sufficient.  If your load balancer is stateless and performs address-tuple routing on long headers and connection ID routing on short headers, you are relying on a different assumption:  that long headers are only used prior for that period the address is stable during setup.  If we ever found a use for a long header long after connection establishment, the load balancer wouldn't know that and it might route things differently.\r\n\r\nThat's not a great situation to be in.",

This means that it is likely - and indeed desirable - for new versions of QUIC to conform to these expectations.  By doing so, a new version of QUIC will be able to use load balancers that conform to the design in this document.\r\n\r\nThat's a fairly compelling trade: make a small additional allowance to get all this stuff.

The LB can then simply discard any packet that maps to an invalid server (unless it has a long header). But this true of the existing design, and isn't unique to 3-pass.\r\n\r\n> The bit flipping attack against the old algorithm involves using a side channel to obtain the server ID in existing CID, then flipping selected bits to target a specific server.\r\n\r\nFor the whole time I've worked on this, I've dealt with people very concerned about DoS vs. a single server in the pool, and people who don't think this is a problem at all. I (weakly) tend toward the latter camp. (Also, if it _is_ a problem, the plaintext algorithm is a walking DoS vector, but that's a different issue).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, let's assume that it's a problem, and that the attacker has obtained both the positions of the server ID bytes and the server ID for two servers in the pool via a side-channel. Then I guess the attack is to connect to server A, gather a number valid CIDs via NCID frames that have different nonces, and then xor the SID field to route to server B. Is that accurate? If so, do you find that compelling? It seems strictly limited to the number of CIDs I can get from a valid server, so why not just DoS those CIDs to that server instead?",

A linear numbering of the servers will not achieve that, even if you prepend a bunch of zeroes in front of the serial number. \r\n\r\nThe three-pass proposal detects tampering even if the server ID space is used linearly, e.g. even if only numbers lower than N are valid, with N much smaller than the maximum number allowed by the size of the field.
